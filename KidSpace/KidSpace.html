          During this field study, we shared several novel technologies with participants (who are relatively open to new technologies),
          ask their opinions about new technologies and how they would like to use them.<br>
          One finding is that people are more open to technology than before. And they hope technology could help their kids learn through play.<br>
          Thus, kid space is one of our focus area generated from this field study.

          <p>
            What should be included in a kid smart space?<br>
            We listed elements in kids' play space, explore the possible combination of attractive play experience and the technologies we are interested in.

            It provides an environment that delivers fun, educational AR content in a way
            that is responsive to children’s actions, utterances and emotions.<br>
            While VR/AR headset is not recommended for kid under 12, our AR projecting solution could adapt to younger kids and encourage them to move around.

            Oscar is a projected agent who can guide kids learning through play.
            Oscar understands the surrounding environment and has auto speech recognition capability, so he
            can respond to people and ojects in the environment.

              The Kid Space system maps the physical
              world to a virtual space, provides fine grain control of the
              projection multi-axis unit, and provides interaction with the
              projected content.
              </p>
          <br><br><br><br>


          <h4>User Study</h4>
          <p>
            Two preliminary studies evaluated Kid Space with children
            5 to 8 years old.<br>
            Because technology is not ready at this time, we tested the experiences using a “Wizard of Oz” methodology<br><br>
          </p>

          <h4>Study 1</h4>
          <p>
            The following photos and previous video are from Study 1. <br><br>
            It was loosely structured
            and exploratory , allowing the
            acquisition of qualitative data to indicate children’s responses to the interactive character and of parent ratings of the system after
            they observed the session. <br><br>
            The wizard wizards in the control room spoke
            freely and naturally with the children through Oscar. The wizards
            did not rigorously follow a script but
            led the children through the planned activities such as "do math with Oscar", "Red light/ green light".<br><br>

            The study was composed of five sessions. <br>
            In each session 2
            parents from different families each brought 1 or 2 children.<br>
            Thus each session had 2 parents and 2-4 children for a total of 16
            children and 10 parentsparents.

          <h4>Study 2</h4>

          <p>
            Study 2 was more tightly structured than Study 1 and focused on
            evaluating two aspects of Kid Space : the AR presentation style
            and the agent’s awareness of the physicality of the children.<br>
            The study included 8 sessions, each with 2 parents, usually from
            different families, and 2 children, for a total of 16 children and 16 parents.<br>
            The parents watched
            passively during the session and then responded to questionnaires
            at the end of each session.

                Study 2 found that children engaged with a
                projected agent at a closer distance than with a television. <br><br>
                Parents showed a preference for a projected AR agent over an agent on a
                television or a standard projection.<br>
                The reasons for the parents’ preferences included that children remained more
                mentally present in their environment with the AR projection
                compared to a television or floating projection.
